This program is using the Raspberry Pi Pico to gather data using a simple PIR sensor

It requires only 3 points of interconnect between the Pico and the PIR.

Connect the Pico's GP16 to PIR sensor's OUT pin

Connect the Pico's 3.3V Pin to PIR sensor's OUT pin

Connect the Pico's GND pin to PIR sensor's GND pin

Please note to create a data.txt file manually on the Pico prior to running the program the first time
